<p>The music and sounds have been assigned to Josh to create, using a mixture of Cubase, FL Studio and GXSCC, a program which converts MIDI files to 8-bit sounding WAV files. I am in the process of adding more words to the dictionary. I have also started work on optimising the game to make it compatible on more devices. Touchscreen support is also in the works â€“ I am not sure if we will be able to implement it by the due date though.

<p>We have decided to switch to another engine, Construct 2. This will allow for greater flexibility, as it works on any device that has a recent browser. However, it is more resource intensive than GameMaker. All the menus have been finished and the Easy Stage has been started. It is quite a bit more complicated than we expected it to be! However we have kinda figured it out and will be working on it. We have decided to host our project on GitHub, as it is easy to collaborate on projects. It also provides free web and project hosting. We have also began work on our background music and sounds. They have a NES 8-bit like style to them.

<p>This is the week we have begun to program our game. The sprites by Josh are mostly finished, however we need to run them to Photoshop batch processing to remove the white backgrounds and scale them to the correct size. My install of GameMaker has not worked for some reason so I need to get it working quickly.
